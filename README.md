This represents my first attempt at an HTML portfolio. It is comprised of an HTML and a CSS file, and in future will include scripting.

Note that at present many of the page elements are placeholders. This includes the text in the "about me" section, as well as the thumbnail images standing in for showcase work.

Each of the elements comprising the "work" section are hyperlinked and will eventually lead to online examples of my work. At present, they link to Rickrolls, because Rickrolls are funny - and if you don't think so, you can get your own portfolio. Also leading to Rickrolls are the phone and email links in the contact section and the resume nav link in the header.

The linking functionality in the thumbnails is a good example of something I found over and over again while producing this sample portfolio. While searching for information on how I could make those work, I found numerous sites assuring me that using photos as links was either impossible or required javascript. Eventually, though, I  found a different site offering a simple solution involving the nesting of tags - something so simple, even I could understand it.
